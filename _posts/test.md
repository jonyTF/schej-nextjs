## Brainstorming

What copy to include in the landing page of Schej to emphasize the USC and Berkeley origin story?



* We should probably make an About page where we include bios about each of us and a shortened version of a founding story (shortened bc we’re going to have longer articles detailing each step of the process)


## Landing Page specifically

_Include a simple line of text beneath the rest of the text on the landing page, add only one more line to that section. Character Limit: &lt;70_



1. Founded by UC Berkeley and USC students who wanted a better scheduling solution.
    1. 80 characters, needs to be shorter
2. Made by UC Berkeley and USC students who wanted a better scheduling solution.
    2. 77 Characters, still too long
3. Founded by UC Berkeley and USC students who wanted a superior scheduling solution.
    3. 82 characters, too long, Points for alliteration though
4. Founded by UC Berkeley and USC students seeking superior scheduling.
    4. 68 characters, shorter, still alliterative, but too vague/not enough info?
5. Created by UC Berkeley and USC Students for you and your friends!
    5. 65 characters, more upbeat/cheerful, but not serious enough/vibes off?

Questions



* Founded or Created? Which is better? Is Founded too pretentious? Do we want to be pretentious? It seems to be working out well for Apple but terribly for Disney, so it’s hard to say
*
