Group meetings are notoriously difficult to schedule, especially in college when students have varying class, activity, and sleep schedules. There are a variety of scheduling software tools available, including Doodle, which has useful features like integration with video conferencing and with external calendar applications. However, Doodle’s abundance of features and elements of the user experience are detrimental to a user’s goal of scheduling with ease. 

In this blog post, we’ll be comparing the features of the scheduling platforms Schej and Doodle, demonstrating that Schej is the superior tool for scheduling group meetings for college students and young adults.

Here is a table summarizing key differences: 

| Schej                                    | Doodle                                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Google Calendar integration              | Google Calendar support                               |
| Multiple calendar account support        | No support for multiple calendars                     |
| Schedule GCal event directly from Schej  | Separate scheduling flow within Doodle                |
| Free to use (no login required)          | Paid Premium version, limited free version available  |
| Mobile-friendly design                   | Unintuitive Mobile User Flow                          |
| Modern UI design                         | Oversaturated with ads                                |

## Features

Schej stands out with its accessibility, offering a completely free platform without limitations. Schej allows users to specify available time ranges in an unconstrained way, creating a set of overlapping availability instead of trying to fit participants’ schedules into fixed time slots. This feature is especially beneficial when coordinating schedules for larger groups or accommodating varying availability among participants.

Meanwhile, Doodle's limitations within its free version, coupled with an interface cluttered with advertisements, detract from the user experience. Fixed duration meetings and restrictions on individual time slots can hinder flexibility in scheduling, especially for groups with tight schedules or intricate availability patterns.


## User Experience

Schej prioritizes a seamless user experience by providing an ad-free platform. This design choice ensures a clean interface, enabling uninterrupted scheduling without the distractions and interruptions posed by advertisements. Users can focus solely on the task at hand—scheduling meetings efficiently and effectively.

In contrast, Doodle's interface suffers from an abundance of advertisements, disrupting the user experience and making the scheduling process cumbersome. The presence of ads, whether visual or in video format, detracts from the platform's usability and efficiency.


## Google Calendar Integration

Schej excels in streamlining scheduling through its seamless integration with Google Calendar. The platform ensures a hassle-free experience by automating availability entry directly from users' linked calendars. This eliminates the need for manual input, guaranteeing accuracy and saving users valuable time.

On the other hand, Doodle's calendar integration leaves something to be desired. Only event creators are able to link their Google Calendar to an event – event attendees are not.


## Conclusion

For college students and young adults seeking a scheduling tool that prioritizes simplicity and ease of use, Schej emerges as the superior choice. Its seamless Google Calendar integration, ad-free interface, and emphasis on streamlined features make it the ideal platform. In contrast, Doodle's diverse features and advertisement-heavy interface complicate rather than simplify scheduling, making Schej the optimal alternative for those seeking a more straightforward scheduling experience.
