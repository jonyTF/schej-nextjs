Between differences in sleep schedules, classes at any time of day, and the general chaos of college, it can be very difficult to schedule meetings for group projects or club events. This is why many college students use a scheduling website called When2meet, which provides users with adequate group scheduling. However, When2meet has some key design and usability flaws that make it difficult to use in some key use cases.

In this blog post, we’ll be comparing the features, mobile support, design, and user support of the scheduling platforms Schej and When2meet, demonstrating that Schej is the superior tool for scheduling group meetings.

Here is a table summarizing the key differences:

| Schej                                    | When2meet                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Google Calendar integration              | No Google Calendar support        |
| Multiple calendar account support        | No support for multiple calendars |
| Schedule GCal event direction from Schej | No GCal event creation support    |
| Free to use (no login required)          | Free to use (no login required)   |
| Mobile-friendly design                   | Desktop support only              |
| Modern UI design                         | Decade-old UI design              |

## Google Calendar Integration

While When2meet is functional, it feels dated and lacks modern group scheduling capabilities. Schej, on the other hand, shines with its sleek interface and Google Calendar integration. No more tabbing between When2meet and your Google Calendar to manually drag out your availability—Schej's seamless integration saves you time by taking the availability directly from your Google Calendar.

Moreover, Schej supports signing in with multiple Google accounts, a major perk for users with personal and university accounts. This feature makes Schej the top pick for students, freelancers, and entrepreneurs seeking an efficient scheduling solution.

Once everyone's availability has been added, Schej makes it easy to schedule a Google Calendar event directly from Schej at the most convenient time for all participants.

## Mobile Support

When2meet is accessible on mobile browsers, but their page isn't responsive, making it cumbersome to use on phones. This is problematic because most scheduling links come through mobile group chats. Schej, designed with mobile users in mind, offers a user-friendly mobile experience. Its event creation tools and share links are optimized for mobile use, ensuring that you can easily schedule and coordinate events directly from your phone.

## User Support

Both tools understand the importance of user feedback. When2meet provides an email address for inquiries. Schej takes it a step further, offering a feedback button on its homepage that directs users to a Google Form for open-ended feedback, with a direct email contact for the development team.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the choice between Schej and When2meet depends on your specific needs and preferences. If you prioritize seamless Google Calendar integration, support for multiple Google accounts, a modern UI/UX, mobile accessibility, and robust user support, Schej is the superior option. However, if you find a simpler tool to be adequate for your needs, When2meet might still be a suitable choice.
