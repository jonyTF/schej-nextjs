When we first launched Schej, our mission was simple: help groups find the right time to meet—faster, easier, and without the back-and-forth. But as we grew, we heard one piece of feedback again and again:

> “How do you pronounce that?”
>
> “Is it ‘skedj’? ‘shay’? ‘skedge’?”
>
> “I tried to tell my friends about it, but I had to spell it out every time.”

We get it. As much as we loved the quirks of the name, Schej was hard to pronounce, hard to spell, and—honestly—easy to forget. So we decided to fix that.

## Meet Timeful.

Timeful is everything Schej was, just easier to say, share, and remember. The name better reflects our core mission: helping people spend less time coordinating and more time doing what matters.

We're excited about this change and what's ahead for Timeful.
