Doodle used to be the obvious choice for scheduling group meetings. But in recent years, it's become cluttered with ads, slow to use, and frustratingly complicated for something that should be simple. If you're looking for a better experience, here are four alternatives that actually make scheduling easy again:

## 1. Timeful (formerly Schej) – Fast, Clean, and Frictionless

[Timeful](https://timeful.app) was built specifically to fix the problems that make Doodle frustrating today.

- No misleading ads disguised as buttons

- Everyone's availability is clearly visible in one glance

It's also open source, privacy-respecting, and optimized to load fast on any device. If you've ever felt annoyed by how long it takes to set up a Doodle poll or how confusing the final results are, Timeful is what you wish Doodle still was.

[When2meet](https://when2meet.com) isn't pretty, but it's reliable. You create a time grid, others mark when they're free, and that's it. No logins, no accounts, and barely any learning curve.

- No signup required
- Visual grid makes it easy to compare times
- Works well for casual and recurring meetups

It's one of the fastest tools to get started with, especially for groups who don't want to deal with anything fancy.

## 3. WhenIsGood – Private Responses for Sensitive Scheduling

![WhenIsGood preference-based scheduling](/blog/assets/blog/doodle-alternatives/whenisgood.png)

[WhenIsGood](https://whenisgood.net)'s main advantage is privacy: only the poll creator can see individual responses, making it ideal for workplace scheduling or situations where you don't want everyone seeing each other's availability.

- Only the organizer sees who responded when
- No signups necessary
- Dated UI but functional

Best for sensitive scheduling situations where privacy matters more than a modern interface.

- Simple poll setup
- Clean interface with email notifications
- Actively developed and community-supported

While it doesn't have all the fine-tuned features of others, it's a solid option for general-purpose scheduling.
